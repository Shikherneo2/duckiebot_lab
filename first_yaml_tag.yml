# This file describes how tags are placed on objects.
#
# This can also be used to provide tag aliases, or transform the computed
# origin of a tag.
#
# This sample file define 3 objects, and covers the different options
# available.

# This first object has only one tag (ID 0). 'myobject1' is the name returned
# by the object detector. The size of the tag is 20x20 (the unit does not
# matter, but must be consistent with the calibration unit. We recommend to use
# millimeters).
# This simple declaration allows to define name aliases for tags. 'tag'
# and 'size' are the only two mandatory fields.
Tag1(TopLeft):
    - tag: 13
      size: 10.9

Tag2(TopRight):
    - tag: 978
      size: 3.8
      # translation: [80, 0, 0]

Tag3(BottomRight):
    - tag: 972
      size: 3.8
